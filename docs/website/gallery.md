# Gallery

The main image gallery is located at the route `/gallery`.

## **Adding images to the gallery**

Adding images should be done directly in **Imageki.io** -> `MES-AA/Gallery`.

There is no image upload option from the website. The Association intends to use the free tier of **Imagekit.io** to the extent possible. The free tier currently offers 20GB of free bandwidth monthly. With the caching strategy that has been implemented, this is more than sufficient for the foreseeable future.

## **Steps to limit bandwidth usage**

1. Keep the number of images in gallery limited to 50. Delete older images if required to keep the gallery fresh
2. Preferably upload images in the `.jpg` format
3. Compress the images by running them through [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) (or a similar utility) prior to uploading
