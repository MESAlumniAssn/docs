# Association Members

The details of the association members visible in `/about` are stored in the `committee` table. Additions or changes therefore need to be made in this table whenever there are any personnel changes.

The table contains the `role` column to differentiate between Office Bearers (`role = ob`) and Management Committee Members (`role = mc`).

## **Profile photos**

All profile photos are stored in **Imagekit.io**.

- Office Bearers - `MES-AA/Site_Images/About/Committee/OB`
- MC Members - `MES-AA/Site_Images/About/Committee/MC`

:fontawesome-solid-hand-point-right:{ .main } To keep the bandwidth usage low, delete photos of members who are no longer OB's or MC Members<br />
:fontawesome-solid-hand-point-right:{ .main } Preferably upload images in the `.jpg` format<br />
:fontawesome-solid-hand-point-right:{ .main } Compress the images by running them through [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) (or a similar utility) prior to uploading
